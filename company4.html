              <h2>How the data was analyzed by ClearTerms:</h2>
              <p>
                Our method for analyzing websites uses a machine learning model that we built.
                This model is based on crowdsourced surveys that we conducted to capture people's
                opinion on various privacy statements.
                You can see more information about the logistics in the <a href="faq.html">FAQ Page.</a>
              </p>
              </br>
              <h2> How does this work? </h2>
              <p> ClearTerms chooses these terms via a machine learning algorithm
                based on crowdsourcing. </br> </br> Hundreds of people identified
                terms they thought were important; their opinions were tested for
                consistency and then used to train the model. </p>

            <div id="term-content">
              <p> Here are a few examples: </br></br>
      
                  The Intellectual Property disclosure will inform users that the
                  contents, logo and other visual media you created is your property
                  and is protected by copyright laws. </br>
      
                  <span class="emphasis">A Termination clause will inform that users'
                  accounts on your website and mobile app or users' access to your
                  website and mobile (if users can't have an account with you) can be
                  terminated in case of abuses or at your sole discretion. </span></br>
      
                  A Governing Law will inform users which laws govern the agreement.
                  This should the country in which your company is headquartered or
                  the country from which you operate your website and mobile app.</br>
      
                  A Links To Other Web Sites clause will inform users that you are
                  not responsible for any third party websites that you link to.
                  This kind of clause will generally inform users that they are
                  responsible for reading and agreeing (or disagreeing) with the
                  Terms and Conditions or Privacy Policies of these third parties.</br>
      
                  If your website or mobile app allows users to create content and make
                  that content public to other users, a Content section will inform
                  users that they own the rights to the content they have created.
                  <span class="emphasis">The "Content" clause usually mentions that
                  users must give you (the website or mobile app developer) a license
                  so that you can share this content on your website/mobile app and to
                  make it available to other users.</span></br></br>
      
                  Because the content created by users is public to other users,
                  a DMCA notice clause (or Copyright Infringement ) section is
                  helpful to inform users and copyright authors that, if any
                  content is found to be a copyright infringement, you will respond
                  to any DMCA takedown notices received and you will take down the
                  content.</br></br>
                 
                  A Limit What Users Can Do clause can inform users that by agreeing
                  to use your service, they're also agreeing to not do certain things.
                  This can be part of a very long and thorough list in your Terms and
                  Conditions agreements so as to encompass the most amount of negative
                  uses.
