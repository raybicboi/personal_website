        <div class="col-lg-7">
          <p>ClearTerms helps internet users better understand the policies they are implicitly agreeing to.
            It uses a crowdsourcing model to highlight the terms that users find most valuable.
            This helps online shoppers be more informed, and <span class="emphasis">helps consumer rights advocates
            and public policy makers </span>better understand the ecommerce ecosystem.

        <div class="col-lg-7">
          <p>Almost every web site has a Terms and Conditions, and they are often too difficult
            and too painful to read. Researchers Aleecia McDonald and Lorrie Cranor calculated that
            it would take a person <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/03/reading-the-privacy-policies-you-encounter-in-a-year-would-take-76-work-days/253851/" class="link" target="_blank">76 work days</a>
            to read all the Terms & Conditions they encounter in a year. Extrapolated over the U.S. population,
            it would cost <span class="emphasis">$781 billion dollars.</span> Another infographic from Reddit compares
            the length of Terms & Conditions from popular sites to <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/coolguides/comments/g5uarl/nobody_got_time_for_that/" class="link" target="_blank">classic works of literature.</a>

          <h4>How exactly does ClearTerms work?</h4>
        </div>
        <div class="col-lg-7">
          <p>ClearTerms uses a Machine Learning model to automatically extract important statements from websites’ T&C documents.
            To build the model, we collected over 1500+ statements from 27 e-commerce websites, and hired crowd workers to
            manually label which ones are important to know.
            <br><br>To make the labeling process easier and more robust, we employed a
            method called <span class="emphasis">pairwise comparison</span>, in which crowd workers select between two
            statements at a time. This pairwise comparison method not only makes the labeling process easier for crowd workers
            but also generates more reliable and accurate results.
            <br><br>The comparison results are then fed into a <span class="emphasis">statistical model</span>
            that will produce the ranking of statements, and finally, we used that result to train our model.

          <h4>But everyone has different definitions of “importance,” right?</h4>

        <div class="col-lg-7">
          <p>Not as much as you’d think. In our research, we found <span class="emphasis">high voting consistency.</span>
            The voting variances of the most important & least important statements are significantly lower than the middle statements.
            In other words, <span class="emphasis">the most important and least important statements are highly agreed upon.</span>

            The model was tested for accuracy via <span class="emphasis">5-fold cross-validation.</span> Ultimately, the model reached 86.8% accuracy,
            93.2% recall, and 82.0% precision in detecting user-labelled important clauses.

        <div class="col-lg-7">
          <p>
            We used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson%27s_chi-squared_test" class="link" target="_blank">Pearson’s chi-squared test</a>
            to find the top 20 words most correlated with important statements in our data set. This plot suggests consumers place
            high value on potential <span class="emphasis">financial loss</span>, with terms like “fee”, “price”, and “damages”.
            Many words are also related to return/cancellation policies, e,g, “cancel”, “terminate”, and “original”, as are words relating
            to shipping policies, e.g. “distribute”, “days”, and “shipping”.

          <h4>What statement types do consumers seem to care most about?</h4>
        </div>
        <div class="col-lg-7">
          <p>
            We found that statements relating to <span class="emphasis">product/services</span> - specifically those related to
            returning, cancellation, and shipping policies - appeared the highest number of times, comprising a third of the
            top 5 statements. For example, one site stipulates: “Unless you cancel within 14 days from today, you will be
            automatically charged the full purchase fee ($88.92) 14 days from today and enrolled in our auto-ship program.”
            <br><br><a href="https://www.neimanmarcus.com/c/Assistance/Privacy-Policy-Terms-of-Use-cat33940739" class="link" target="_blank">
            Neiman Marcus</a> informs consumers of their “...ongoing commitment to ensure that your shopping experience...is protected,
            we will prosecute all unauthorized or fraudulent transactions to the fullest extent allowed by law.”
            This statement type frequency suggests that consumers place a high value on <span class="emphasis">money-related issues</span>,
            which corresponds to our chi-square test results in the previous section.
            <br><br> The second most frequent statement type relates to the company’s ability to <span class="emphasis">control content
            generated and uploaded by the user.</span> For example, <a href="https://sgsg.samsung.com/service/agreement.php" class="link" target="_blank">Samsung</a>
            states their right that “Any Submission may be used by Samsung without restriction for any purpose whatsoever, including,
            without limitation, reproduction, disclosure, transmission, publication, broadcast or posting...”. Other high ranking statements
            refer to the company’s right to delete user content, or to even fine users for bad reviews on review websites.

        </div>
        <div class="col-lg-7">
          <p>
            We're not perfect! Some of our limitations include:
            <ul>
              <li>The model only works for <span class="emphasis">e-commerce</span> sites right now.</li>
              <li>Though pairwise comparison lowers the cognitive load for crowd workers, pulling individual
                statements out from the full document may lose some context.</li>
              <li>Terms and Conditions are filled with complex jargon that is sometimes hard to understand
                in the first place. It's hard for people to understand a <span class="emphasis">"worldwide license"
                to use content you generate"</span> or phrases like <span class="emphasis">"in perpetutity."</span>

          <h4>How is ClearTerms different from TOS;DR?</h4>
        </div>
        <div class="col-lg-7">
          <p>
            Much like ClearTerms, <a href="https://tosdr.org/" class="link" target="_blank">TOS;DR</a> aims to analyze
            the terms of service and privacy policies of major Internet sites and services. While TOS;DR relies fully
            on crowd workers to do this, ClearTerms uses a natural language model to rank important statements.
            There's pros and cons to both, but this allows us to <span class="emphasis">analyze more policies</span>,
            and makes it easier for us to keep our analyses <span class="emphasis">up to date</span> as web sites
            update their Terms and Conditions.
            <br><br>We're not the only ones using ML to look at online activity! There are more projects going on
            at <a href="https://www.isri.cmu.edu/" class="link" target="_blank">CMU</a>, including those in
